# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user authentication and management system for the ft_transcendence Pong game platform. The system will provide secure user registration, login, profile management, and session handling capabilities that comply with the project's security requirements including password hashing, input validation, and HTTPS protection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Registration

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with a unique username and email, so that I can participate in tournaments and track my game history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides username, email, and password THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs before processing
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with hashed password
3. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email or username THEN the system SHALL reject the registration with appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user provides a password shorter than 6 characters THEN the system SHALL reject the registration
5. WHEN a user provides an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL reject the registration
6. WHEN a user provides a username shorter than 3 or longer than 20 characters THEN the system SHALL reject the registration
7. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token and user profile

### Requirement 2: User Authentication

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to securely log into my account, so that I can access my profile and participate in games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate and return a JWT token
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL reject the login with appropriate error message
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL update their online status to true
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL update their last login timestamp
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL NOT reveal whether email or password was incorrect

### Requirement 3: Session Management

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to be maintained securely, so that I don't need to re-authenticate frequently while using the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives a JWT token THEN the token SHALL expire after 24 hours
2. WHEN a user makes authenticated requests THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token
3. WHEN a user's token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL reject the request with 401 status
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL update their online status to false
5. IF a user's account is deleted THEN their existing tokens SHALL become invalid

### Requirement 4: Profile Management

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to view and update my profile information, so that I can maintain accurate account details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user requests their profile THEN the system SHALL return their current profile data without password hash
2. WHEN an authenticated user updates their username THEN the system SHALL validate uniqueness and format requirements
3. WHEN an authenticated user updates their email THEN the system SHALL validate format and uniqueness requirements
4. WHEN profile updates are successful THEN the system SHALL return the updated profile data
5. WHEN profile updates fail validation THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5: Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want user data to be securely stored and transmitted, so that user privacy and security are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user password is stored THEN the system SHALL hash it using bcrypt with salt rounds of 12 or higher
2. WHEN user data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS connections
3. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent XSS attacks
4. WHEN executing database queries THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
5. WHEN JWT tokens are generated THEN they SHALL include user identification and expiration time
6. WHEN sensitive data is logged THEN the system SHALL NOT log passwords or tokens

### Requirement 6: Database Integration

**User Story:** As a system, I need to persistently store user data in a reliable database, so that user information is maintained across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize the SQLite database with proper schema
2. WHEN user data is stored THEN it SHALL include proper timestamps for created_at and updated_at
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses
4. WHEN foreign key constraints exist THEN the database SHALL enforce referential integrity
5. WHEN user queries are performed THEN the system SHALL use database indexes for optimal performance
